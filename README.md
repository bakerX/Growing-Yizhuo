# Growing-Yizhuo
The Growing story of my son, Yizhuo XU. 
On Aril 23rd. 2017 13:50, my son Yizhuo XU was born in Shanghai United Family Hosital. After several rounds of naming selection, Yizhuo 
was the final decision. "濯" is derived from the famous oem by Dunyi ZHOU from Song Dynasty, "吾独爱莲之出淤泥而不染，濯清涟而不妖。"
